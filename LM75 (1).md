# Working with LM75 module

LM75 temperature module is a digital temperature sensor that is widely used in many small electronic projects. It is designed specifically for the Banana Pi, but it can also be used with Arduino. The module uses the NXP LM75 Temperature IC. The LM75 temperature sensor includes a delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter and a digital over-temperature detector.

# How to use

First of all use the [github link](https://github.com/jlz3008/lm75) to download the library and use it. Then just before the `Setup() function` insert the following code:
 `TempI2C_LM75 termo = TempI2C_LM75(0x48,TempI2C_LM75::nine_bits)`.
 and in the code you can use the function `termo.getTemp()`
 to get the current temperature.
